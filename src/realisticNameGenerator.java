/**
 * A class to provide a passenger manifest using realistic
 * first and last names, using popular (ie) frequent first
 * and last names in the US. The class comprises three String
 * arrays with common masculine and feminine first names. In
 * a tribute to my COMP 170 SP 20 students -- the first class
 * to go online due to COVID-19, in March 2020 -- I am using
 * their last names in array lastnames[].
 *
 * The class comprises a method that returns a randomly generated
 * name, with a 50-50 probability for a male or female person.
 *
 * To use this class, instantiate it first, then access its
 * .realisticName() method.
